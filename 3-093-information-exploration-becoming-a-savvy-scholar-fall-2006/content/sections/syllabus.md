About this Course
-----------------

This course is part of a project developed by staff of the MIT Libraries and Professor Donald Sadoway and funded by MIT's d'Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in Education. The project, titled "Finding and Evaluating Information," is designed to introduce first year students to the scientific research process and provide them with the skill necessary to find, evaluate and use information successfully throughout their educational careers. The project consists of this course, 3.093, and the set of online tutorial modules that students will review and evaluate.
